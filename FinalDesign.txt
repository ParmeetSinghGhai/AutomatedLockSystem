Description
=================================
The Circuit is split into two parts :
1) one part generates trigger pulses after counting down 0 to 14 one hour long cycles. the 15th cycle act as alarm for a stepper motor to rotate in anticlock wise direction. this part uses one of the timers present in 556 IC which generates one second pulses, CD4040 which acts on those one second pulses to count down 3600 seconds or one hour and then hourly clock pulse generated by CD4040 is fed into one counter of the 74HC393 IC which counts down from one hour upto 15 hours. on it 15th bit, the output high on this bit is used as a alarm to get the stepper motor activated in anticlockwise direction. CD4040 has a bit pattern of 111000010000 at 3600 counts. All the 1s have a 4148 diode connected in reverse bias with their cathodes connected to the pins and the anodes are all tied together. VCC is fed into the anode via pull up resistor. this is then fed into a AO3400 NMOS to acts a NOT gate and its output is then fed to a 4148 diode at its anode. lets call this junction A. all the low bits have a 4148 connected to them as well. each one of those pins is connected to the anode of those diodes while the cathodes are tied together and connected to a pull down resistor and that is also connected to junction A. 
The idea here is that when all the high bits are high then the output via NOT gate should be low while when all the low bits are low then the output will be low. these two outputs are ORed together to form a hourly clock pulse. under normal circumstance, this clock pulse will stay high via pull up resistor and will only go low when all the high bits of CD4040 which are suppose to be high are high and all the low bits of CD4040 which are suppose to be low are low and that makes the clock pulse go low for a second. After that CD4040 resets. This hourly clock pulse is fed to the one 4 bit counter of 74HC393 which counts upto 15. the 15th bit stays high for one hour and then the counter is reset.
The 15th bit output is split into 2 via 2 series resistors say R1 and R2

2)The second part of the circuit controls the rotation of the stepper motor in clockwise and anticlockwise direction. it consists of the second timer of the 556 IC, 74HC164 shift register and 2 ULN2003 ICs. 
The 556 timer's reset is tied low and is being ORed with R2 and a PMOS drain. PMOS is activated from the very beginning and has its gate grounded via pull up. it has a boost capacitor connected to its gate which needs to be charged via manual push switch to 2 x VCC thus stopping the PMOS from conducting. This acts as a ONE TIME delay for the activation of the stepper motor in clockwise direction. The boost capacitor slowly discharges via a discharge resistor thus allowing the PMOS to be activated after a certain delay. 
The 74HC164 has one its Data load pins connected to VCC and the other to the Q1 of one the 4 bit counters of 74HC393. the bits Q1 to Q4 of the 164 IC are ORed together and fed into the reset of the 393 counter thus allowing only 2 bits in 164 IC to be loaded hence forming the FULL WAVE activation pattern for the stepper motor. The Q4 is also ORed together with the Q1 of 393 counter to second data line of 164 so bits can be loaded from end to begining hence forming a cycle of FULL WAVE pattern for acivating the stepper motor. 
The shift register outputs Q0 to Q0 are fed into the two ULN2003 chips but in opposite pins where one ULN2003 gets Q0 to Q4 matched with its Pin0 to Pin 4 while another gets the opposite where Q0 to Q4 are matched with Pin 4 to Pin 0 allowing the stepper motor to rotate in clockwise and anticlockwise directions. 
There are 2 NMOS connected to the ground of the 2 ULN2003 ICs. The gate of these NMOSes Controls which ULN2003 conducts VCC from the stepper motor to ground hence the direction of the stepper motor. 
one ULN2003's NMOS has drain from the PMOS connected to it while the other ULN2003's NMOS has R2 .
Also both the NMOSes here have their gates connected to 2 individual  photo transistors which acivates via photo emitter diodes at approprite STOP locations for the motor. 

Basic Working Theory
================================
At Start up, PMOS is delayed due to the boost capacitor and R2/R1 have not been activated yet due to the hourly delay set by user. when the boost capacitor discharges, PMOS starts up and activates 556 and the gate of one of the ULN2003's NMOS thus making the stepper motor rotate in clockwise direction. when the phototransistor tied to the gate of this NMOS actibvates then the gate of this nmos is pulled down and the stepper motor stops.
BONUS: if somebody tries to force the motor to rotate in the opposite direction then the motor will start back up again and rotate back into its original STOP position. 
When R1 and R2 signals get activated due to the hourly alarm counter then R1 stops the PMOS by driving the gate of the PMOS high while R2 is fed to one of the other ULN2003's NMOS gate which activates the stepper motor in anti-clockwise direction. The phototransistor tied to the gate of this NMOS pulls the gate down when stepper motor reaches its second STOP position. 
if somebody forces the motor to rotate in the opposite direction then the motor will turn back on and go back to its original STOP position.
Here R2 is pulled down as well but not R1 thus PMOS stays off. This happens for an hour and when hourly pulses counter resets then the cycle repeats itself.

SAFE FROM RESET CONDITION:
==========================
in the case of a SYSTEM RESET, the PMOS is activated right away thereby activating the motor in clockwise direction while the R1/R2 signals again go through hourly count down to get activated.
